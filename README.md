# Discrete Math Tool

Welcome to the **Discrete Math Tool**! This application is designed to help users perform various discrete mathematics calculations, including combinations, permutations, probability, statistics, graph theory, Fibonacci sequence, and set operations. The tool has a user-friendly interface built using the Tkinter library in Python.

## Features

1. **Combinations and Permutations**
   - Calculate combinations and permutations with or without replacement.
   
2. **Binomial Theorem**
   - Calculate binomial expansions using Newton's binomial theorem.

3. **Probability Calculations**
   - Compute basic probabilities and conditional probabilities.

4. **Graph Theory**
   - Calculate the degree of a vertex based on the number of edges.

5. **Fibonacci Sequence**
   - Generate Fibonacci sequences up to a specified number.

6. **Statistics**
   - Calculate mean, variance, standard deviation, sum, and product of a list of numbers.
   - Check if numbers are even or odd.

7. **Set Operations**
   - Perform union, intersection, difference, and complement of two sets.

8. **GCD and LCM**
   - Calculate the Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) and Least Common Multiple (LCM) of a list of numbers.

## Installation

1. Make sure you have Python installed on your machine (Python 3.x is recommended).
2. Clone the repository or download the source code files.
3. Install Tkinter if it is not already installed. You can usually install it via your package manager or by using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install tk
